The grate blew out my left front tire and severely damaged (but did not puncture) my left rear tire. My left front wheel was also damaged heavily. Luckily, I was able to stop at AM Mufflers & Tire just down the road to have a spare put on. The employee also gave me an estimate of the cost of two new tires and a new wheel, which I will be filing a claim for.

Now it turns around in the intersection of girard and genter and completely misses the 1000 block of Genter Street. Problem is there is a public parking lot with a giant pine tree that leaves pine debris all over the street and curbs. Because the pine tree is on city property there are no lawn guys that maintain the area. It would be nice if this part of Genter could be swept especially while the  tree is shedding so much. It will be even more important in the fall\winter when rain causes the tree mess to clog the street drains.,https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000001uh6hAAA,,30

I live at 2050 Chicago St. 92110 at the bottom of a mild hill in the middle of a T intersection. When it rains any decent amount, the water runs down the street, overflows the curb in front of my house, and floods my property. Including under the house. The street is obviously not code compliant. It has been resurfaced many times ant the curb is only a few inches tall.The street is all marked up for yet another round of construction. Hopefully the street can be sloped properly and brought up to code so I don't need to deal with the city's runoff. I can't aim my gutter towards my neighbors property, and I don't feel the city's water should flow onto mine. I have installed strip drains across the front of my house, at my own expense, but the flooding is so bad the drains are practically useless. Please take the time to inspect the intersection of Mayo St and Chicago St and find a solution to this recurring problem.

The depression occurred after the City had a contractor make sewer line improvements to the sewer system during which they had excavated the sewer line, made the improvements, and then backfilled the trench and restored the brick pavement.  The soil in the trench backfill has settled (I am a certified engineering geologist and knowledge about this issue) and created a tripping hazard for my elderly mother.  I would like the city to remove the brick work and re-compact the trench backfill to make it level and prevent additional settlement from occurring, and then restore the brick work to remove the depression and tripping hazard.  I have request this be done through the City sewer department but I do not know if they will resolve the problem.  The parking strip between the curb and sidewalk is the City property and the work that caused the settlement was done by a City contractor for the City - therefore the City should repair the problem before my mother (or anyone else) stumbles over the depression and hurts themselves - possibly severely (which could happen to my elderly mother).  It would be much more cost effective for the City to fix this problem before anyone gets hurt rather than have to deal with a potential lawsuit if someone gets hurt.

The huge dead branch's with their 12 inch thorns are falling too!  I was told that my copy of this notice releases me of any responsibility for any future possible injuries.  We are many times gone for weeks and come back to your piles of marbles in the street and sidewalk with a few of your deadly branches included.  Should I post this notice on the tree to inform any victims of where to call for injuries?  I'll keep sweeping and my many neighbors can back me up on that statement, but they'll also be able to mention the kindergardeners rolling on the many that keep falling a day or two later.  Luckily no kid or passer-by has yet been speared by one of those many falling branches.  Check it out ASAP!

Also, a once yearly cleaning is insufficient for this drain as the wind blows trash down the street each and every day, much of which ends up being trapped at the entrance to the storm drain.  Also, sediment from the hillside collects at the curb where the street sweeper NEVER cleans and thus the sediment is being blown into the storm drain there on a daily basis.

The soil type on the hillside is a cobble and when any concentrated amount of water hits the hillside it easily erodes. We don't want to have a tower failure at this site due to the storm drain. It was patched in one area several years ago and the blockage at the bottom was cleared. However, it is leaking in other places uphill from the patch. we have installed BMPs to protect the towers but those are only temporary until the storm drain can be properly repaired. Due to the steepness and soil conditions this might be a prime candidate for relining. I must reiterate, there are four transmission circuits of critical importance to keeping the power on in San Diego.

100763,Storm Drain,32.7489711,-117.0839798,8/20/16,"Storm Drain Channel Cleaning at 5135 University Avenue, San Diego, CA 92105, United States",Acknowledged,"A)  The storm drain channel south of 5135 University Avenue is clogged by overgrown brush and trees growing inside the channel, including invasive species such as palm trees.  There is trash and litter in the channel at 5135 University Avenue and west of there, behind 5069 University Avenue, including a City sign that was left behind on January 6 when Storm Drain cleared a build up of branches and twigs from the upstream culvert entrances. Due to the successful growth of trees and shrubs planted in this location in 2007 when the 5135 Auburn Park low income housing complex was built, there is now an ongoing vegetative debris problem with this channel, whereas prior to the growth of tall trees and shrubs, this problem was likely minimal.  Therefore, per the recommendations found in the City's Storm Drain Maintenance Manual, a debris catch fence should be installed upstream from the two concrete culverts located behind 5069 University Avenue.  Because such a debris catch fence was lacking on January 5, 2016, tree debris accumulated across the upstream entrance to the two concrete culverts, preventing storm water from entering the culverts and thus the diversion of the water to properties to the south, including Wightman Street Neighborhood Park where massive flooding occurred.  Debris once again accumulated in May of 2016--I contacted Storm Drain to remove that debris and it did so.  However, debris build up will continue to occur in this area due to the current presence of now mature native trees and shrubs and the resultant year round dropping of twigs, and larger branches into the channel.    According to the records I found online, this portion of the channel was assessed in November 2015, but was NOT cleaned in December 2015 when other portions of the channel downstream from the culverts were cleaned.  The cleaning that was done during that time period began half way through the culverts, according to the report.  Thus this portion of the channel is overdue for: 1) brush removal, 2) litter removal, 3) restoration of original channel depth and width, and 4)  installation of a debris catch fence upstream from the two culverts to prevent future debris from clogging the culvert entrances and causing diversion of storm water to Wightman Street Neighborhood Park and other properties south of the channel.B) On the south side of the channel just ahead of the culvert entrances, a huge slab of the concrete lining the channel broke and slid down, exposing a swath of earth on the south side of the channel (where there is supposed to be concrete) and this will now erode and endanger the remaining concrete lining along the channel.C) There is graffiti everywhere.  There must be ongoing inspection and removal of such graffiti.D) Three difference homeless people have taken up residence in the culverts in succession over the last three months.  They were reported to Storm Drain employee, John Scampone, and were removed.  However, Storm Drain should clearly post No Trespassing signs on the culverts and also provide a hotline phone number for park goers to report transients from living in the culverts.  The defecation and urination that accompanies human habitation of the storm channel culverts and environs is a serious public health issue--and these two culverts connect to Wightman Street Neighborhood Park which is only 120 feet downstream from the culvert entrances.  If you have any questions please call me at 619-442-3821",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t00000033drzAAA,,10

It is very dangerous to the people that have to park back there, as the visibility is low around the corners when they are backing up.

Every time I drive to this intersection a dangerous series of events occur. Either from the far right lane or the middle lane a car insists on getting into the Left turn lane stopping traffic abruptly.Remedies:1) The best remedy is to create a La Jolla Parkway offramp for those driving down 5 South wanting to get to downtown La Jolla.2) Creating a type of barricade dividing the 2 lanes of La Jolla Village Drive towards UCSD after you pass the Villa La Jolla Drive intersection with signage ?to downtown La Jolla?. This signage could hang from the pedestrian bridge, or from the signal poll.3) Simply better signage before and at the intersection. LARGE signage: To downtown La Jolla LEFT lane.

One at the extreme southeast end of the cul-de-sac at a then existing driveway entrance and a second one in the parkway directly across from my home. Sometime after 2003 when my neighbor, Craig Irving, bought the three undeveloped parcels across from me to build a single family residence on the now combined property (4095 Lomaland Drive) both street lights were removed during construction since his improvements included the under grounding of the existing power lines. No replacement street lighting was installed after the removal of power poles. During the last few years since entry into the adjacent nature park was made accessible we have had a significant increase in traffic which unfortunately includes much illegal night time activity including, but certainly not limited to, over night camping, public urination and defecation, under age drinking, drug use, fornication and daily litter related to all of the above. It presents an unsafe condition for both my family and the young families that have recently moved into the immediate neighborhood. I am requesting that an individual light post be reinstalled at the previous location directly across from my home in the interest of discouraging the illegal behavior we have had to tolerate for far too long.

Kids in the neighborhood who walk to and from Ellen Browning Scripps Elementary use this sidewalk M-F and would not want anyone to trip on it.  I also want someone to assess whether we can cut the tree that's causing this?  It has also caused major damage to our water pipes today.  The roots caused the pipes/connections to burst and my husband and our neighbor had to dig a few feet down to remove some of the roots to fix the broken pipes (see attached pictures).  There is another tree by our front yard that we want someone to look at since it looks like its roots are going towards our house and we are afraid that it will cause more damage in the future.  These trees were planted when the community was first built and we would like to know if there's a way we can remove them to prevent major and expensive damage to our property.

Confused drivers intending to go straight when realizing their mistake, rather than make the left, rapidly merge through the intersection into the through lane from the left hand turn lane.  It seems obvious to me, but perhaps the number of tourists in the area in rental cars who don't know about it contribute to the problem, either way, at virtually every cycle of the light, this occurs and carries a high potential for a collision.  There were recently streetworks on Laurel in which a large sign was put up in the center of the road, which blocked the ability for the cars to merge from the left hand turn lane and this seemed to ameliorate the issue somewhat.  I think larger and earlier signage would work.  Thanks,",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t00000034RaIAAU,,0

I'm a corner house next to a elementary school where the kids love to run and roll on these seeds and fall half of the time, while others who are just crossing the street are unwantedly slipping and getting your seeds trapped in their shoes.  I've sent previous warnings about these 20 inch thorns on their 20 foot branches falling with no response!, so you don't mind if I leave copies of these few notices with cars or people who I see injured do you?  These are city trees on city property.  If your trimmers want to trim trees all the less then tell them to trim the branches so that they're at an upward angle, and all of the visable seed pods are removed!  From what I've seen in the past they only trim the dead hanging branches while leaving the green hanging branches. - Yes, I agree that that is the best way for the trees to look, but trimming like I'm saying doesn't take long to  soon look totally normal.  I should know, because I used to professionally trim palms many years ago.

I have noted in the past that the asphalt has been raised in the past by multiple layers and the street level is just 2 inches below the sidewalk, some places are even less. When the heavy rain comes, the water come up to the sidewalk and some residents front yard. Since the crew has dug a big trench for the sewer, we would suggest the city to grind down the surface of the streets and resurface them to an appropriate level. Otherwise these patched areas would make things worse in winter and it's money wasted because eventually they need to be redone.Please have a walk on the street to assess the situation.thank youAnnie Norviel",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t00000039huxAAA,6/16/16,0

I have gained great respect for the complexity of this project that was to be completed by May 15, 2016. Unfortunately they have left the project because a connector elbow is needed. Thus, there are several plates at the top of our street with water leaking out.What needs to be done immediately is a clean sweep of the street. The grinding material and dust is heavy along a wide swath of the street. It is tracked onto our driveways and has been causing staining on our concrete driveway for almost three months.Cant someone send a sweeper out to clean up West Muirlands Drive until the installation can be completed. And, when will the street itself be repaved.Sincerely,Ambassador Dick Capen1384 West Muirlands DriveLa Jolla858-354-6712 (cell)",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t00000039jUNAAY,,75

It blocks reasonable access from the street from a parked car to the sidewalk. In addition, the City fails to control run off from the street and during each rain a torrent of water erodes the soil in the parkway making an unsafe situation.The City has been notified of this situation previously, thus, I felt compelled to take Federal action as well.The tree should be removed, the roots should be ground out, and that would allow me the ability to put in a safe hardscape that is is not a trip and fall hazard and also is safe for the disabled to egress automobiles on the passenger side.Disabled Property Owner - Mark Nelson - menelson@gmail.com",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000003A1n3AAC,7/26/16,34

89679,Curb,32.8206056,-117.2150645,6/23/16,"Curb Faded Paint at Cadman Park and Recreation Center, San Diego, CA, United States",New,"Cadman Park is an active municipal park with many civic functions scheduled throughout the year with attendant parking issues common to public parkland such as this.  Park users require parking spaces to accommodate their needs when visiting Cadman but parked vehicles often create safety issues for nearby residents as well as for those same park users.  Adequate sight lines need to be reserved to permit safe movement onto adjacent streets, especially during times of heavy Park use.  The enclosed photo shows how I believe street markings can be improved to facilitate the safe movement of vehicles being operated in the vicinity of the Park.1.	Red-painted curbs need to be extended to provide better sight lines at these intersections:a.	Moraga Avenue and Moraga Court ? The red-painted curbs should be extended at least two car lengths [36 additional feet] on the west side of Moraga Avenue both north and south of this intersection.  Drivers attempting to enter Moraga Avenue from Moraga Court are blind to traffic both northbound and southbound on Moraga Avenue.b.	Avati Drive and Wayne Lane ? The red-painted curbs need to be extended at least two car lengths [36 additional feet] on the west side of Avati Drive north of this intersection.  Drivers attempting to enter Avati Drive from Wayne Lane are blind to downhill traffic on Avati Drive. [Not depicted on the accompanying photo]2.	Red-painted curb needs to be painted at the driveway to the ball fields at the curve on Avati Drive.  This driveway is the only access to the ballfields for mowers and other equipment and would be the only access for emergency vehicles if those vehicles required access to the ballfields.  It is routinely blocked by vehicles especially during Little League play at Cadman.3.	Red-painted curb should be extended an additional 36 feet to the first residential driveway on the north side of Moraga Court.  Moraga Court is not wide enough west of the Moraga Avenue/Moraga Court intersection to permit a safe clearance between vehicles parked on Moraga Court and vehicles entering Moraga Court from Moraga Avenue.I believe the curb markings described above will provide a significant additional margin of safety for all of us who live and play in the vicinity of Cadman Park. Your attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated by the thousands of visitors who make Cadman Park their destination for outdoor fun throughout the year.",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000003A9d1AAC,,68

89724,Traffic Signal,32.9374619,-117.1271907,6/23/16,Traffic Signal Light Out at mercy road and black mountain rd,Closed,"When traveling west on Mercy road, the light at the intersection of Black Mountain Rd and Mercy will not produce a green light for westbound traffic if someone activates the crosswalk sign on the south side of the intersection.  This would be OK, if it is not activated twice in a row.  However, I have been there two times in the past 3 months and if it is activated twice in a row, the crosswalk permits the pedestrian to cross and still doesn't produce a green light for westbound traffic on mercy road.  I believe that one could stand there all day and hit the crosswalk and completely stop traffic on mercy road.  Could you either require that upon a second activation of the crosswalk, that a green light is produced for westbound mercy road traffic alternately, before the second pedestrian walk light illuminated, or change the timing so that westbound traffic gets a green light after the pedestrian crosswalk has completed its cycle?",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000003AA39AAG,7/7/16,13

The issue is that since the installation of the video-based signal timing adjustment system the left turn lane from Torrey Pines Road to LJ Pkwy does not clear all traffic in the lane resulting in backups to Caminito del Cid.  The previously used in-road sensor would efficiently change the light at low volumes of cross traffic and would consistently time to fully clear the left turn lane on each cycle.  Now it barely clears 4 cars at a time if everyone is quick on the accelerator.  The video timing system is supposed to make things better and might even reduce LJ Pkwy backup at the expense of additional traffic on Torrey Pines Rd towards Ardath Lane.Nearly all signals in the area (TP Road East left turn to TP Road North, TP Road split at Caminito del Cid East, TP Road & LJ Pkwy merge at Caminito del Cid West) seem to have shortened resulting in incomplete clearing of accumulated traffic.

This is being caused by the (northbound) College Ave. left turn light for Lindo Paseo being on when it shouldn't. First, Lindo Paseo is blocked. So, there's no need for the left turn light to be on. Second, the street has been dug up right where the left turn lane would be. My guess is this is causing the signal to think there is a line of cars turning left when the left signal goes on, because it stays on a LONG time, perhaps 4x longer than the left turn signal that comes on for southbound traffic. So, when that left turn signal for southbound traffic turns red and the northbound traffic starts up to head down the hill, the northbound traffic is still WAITING for the left turn signal to (blocked) Lindo Paseo to turn red so their light can turn green. During those 10+ seconds when their light SHOULD be green, the Montezuma Rd. light is also green, providing the needed flow through the area. This left turn signal for Lindo Paseo , on for an unreasonable amount of time,is keeping that flow from happening, and causing the backup all the way down the hill. Sorry for the above ""Type"" selectio nof ""Signal Facing Wrong Direction"".

(92130) appears to have been recently adjusted.  This may be due to the townhome construction project to the east of this intersection.Traffic going through on Carmel Valley Rd. is frequently encountering red lights that last far too long for the cross traffic coming from Shasta Daisy Trail.  Today, at around noon, I sat behind a lineup of cars heading east/west on Carmel Valley Rd. waiting excessively long for the light to turn green while there were simply no cars crossing or entering the intersection from Shasta Daisy Trail.Can this light be adjusted again to give priority to traffic on Carmel Valley Rd.?  The speed limit here is 55mph which is appropriate for this wide road, but the addition of traffic signal lights over the past several years with the ongoing housing and commercial development is making travel along this road very inconvenient.  Better timing of the signals to improve traffic flow and unnecessary waiting would be greatly appreciated.Can the traffic signal at the intersection of Shasta Daisy Trail and Carmel Valley Rd.  please be properly adjusted again to give priority to Carmel Valley Rd. traffic flow?Thanks,Bijan",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000003BYefAAG,7/22/16,7

They're also growing hedges right up to the border of the sidewalk and more often than not, they also have a car or truck parked right up to the curb beside the hoop.  Anybody in a wheelchair or pulling a wagon would have to divert into the middle of the street, and anyone trying to navigate through the obstructions would risk tripping over them.  It's not very neighborly and it's frankly a hazard.I've never seen anyone using the basketball hoop, which would be impossible with the car that's often parked there, but I usually only walk by on weekend mornings.  They're not the only ones who use the public sidewalk for their personal basketball hoop, but it's by far the most difficult and dangerous to navigate.I pointed it out to one of the homeowners as I walked by one morning 2 weeks ago, and I put a note on the hoop last week in an attempt to informally appeal to their sense of reason.  The note is now gone, nothing has changed this week, and again, a car was parked right alongside the hoop this morning.I'm unable to find any specific regulations that speak to leaving portable basketball hoops on the sidewalk, but perhaps you're aware of something.  I'd very much like to see this obstruction removed to make the neighborhood safer and more welcoming to pedestrians.",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000003BbaMAAS,,44

The water builds up in front of my house because it has become a low spot. I really would welcome someone from the city come and take a look at it and asses the situation. Kind regards.

This place being the only exit from our parking lot, the sole action available is to carefully disregard the solid red light.  Is it possible to change the light to a blinker late at night?
