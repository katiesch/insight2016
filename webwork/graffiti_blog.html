       <h2>Predicting Graffiti Rates in San Diego</h2>

       <i>2016/09/24</i>
       

     <div class="plotdiv" id="89556313-b589-45bc-baaf-a3e933260621"></div>

       <p>The mean popularity of explicit tracks is approximately 59,
       while the clean versions score around 32. Although these
       distributions aren't strictly Gaussian, they both have a standard
       deviation of around 12. Just one additional note, I
      also removed the Deluxe version of 'Watch the Throne,' as I
       thought it was a bit unfair to compare something deluxe to
       something standard. </p>

      <p>Right, so explicit versions it is then. I get it; if you're
      listening to Kanye, you want to listen to <i>Kanye being
      Kanye</i>, and that usually involves curse words. When you
     look at the difference in popularity between song versions,
      there's a typical difference of around 25 points.
     </p>

     <div class="plotdiv" id="4095a633-eecd-4c3f-bc5c-cf33f2d49846"></div>

     <p> Note that the largest difference is for 'Ni**as in Paris,' which is peak Kanye
      being Kanye (although I don't think that's a quanitifable
      statement). I've also color-coded the songs in the chart above
      by album, which shows that the difference in popularity between
      explicit and clean versions is typically smaller for "Late Registration"
      than for "Watch the Throne" and "College Dropout." I've also
      overplotted a linear regression (the black dashed line), which
      can be used to predict the typical offset in popularity between
      clean and explicit versions based on a song's popularity. It is
      largely anchored by the three points on the left hand side, as most of the stars are
      in a clump around a difference of 25. </p>

     <p>Now on to the meat of the question: is Kanye better off doing
     his own thing or working with others? </p>

     <div class="plotdiv" id="b7efeb1b-9ab2-45b1-91d3-3a10798aa16a"></div>

     <p>The distributions of popularity for solo and collaborative
       tracks are quite similar to one another. In fact, the average
       popularity for his solo work is 61, while it is 57 for his
       collaborative. </p>

     <p>But are certain collaborations more successful than others?
       For example, Kanye often teams up with Jay Z; in fact "Watch
       the Throne" was a whole album by the two of them. But does
       working together benefit Kanye, popularity-wise? </p>

   <div class="plotdiv" id="57830594-3b21-4c70-929b-2b61cc173dc4"></div>

     <p>The figure above looks at the mean popularity of the tracks
       with a particular collaborator. The red solid line is the mean
       popularity for Kanye alone, and the red dashed lines show the
       standard deviation on this value. The blue solid line shows the
       mean popularity of tracks Kanye makes with collaborators. Jay Z is highlighted in gold,
       and his tracks are actually <i>less</i> popular than Kanye
       alone. In fact, 'Watch the Throne' has the lowest popularity
       rating, although that's likely a function of more people
       listening to the Deluxe version, which has a popularity of 80. 
       Time to reevaluate that friendship? Eh, they're still
       well within the standard deviation of Kanye's popularity alone,
       so I think they're cool. I guess 'Jay is chillin, 'Ye is
       chillin, What more can I say?' </p>

     <p>By this point I'm sure you noticed the elephant in the
     room. Namely, one collaborator drags down Kanye by more than 2
     sigma. Who could that be? Oh right, it's Chris Martin from
     Coldplay. </p>

     <p>Chris Martin is featured on the song 'Homecoming' from the
     album 'Graduation.' It's a love song from Kanye to Chicago, and
     has a fantastic <a
     href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ488QrqGE4">video</a>
     directed by Hype Williams. </p>

     <div class="plotdiv" id="4b45defc-0397-410e-b1af-6f988f6a2f2f"></div>

     <p>'Graduation', circled in cyan above, is slightly above average
     in popularity as an album. And this song, while near the end of the album, is
     not the last one. The following track, "Big Brother", has a score
     of 55. So it's not
     just that people don't make it all the way through the
     album. </p>

     <p>Chris Martin is fairly different as far as Kanye's
     collaborators go. Namely, he's not a rapper. So perhaps this is
     the difference. However, Kanye teamed up with Adam Levine on
     'Heard 'Em Say.' Adam Levine and Chris Martin appeal to a
     similar demographic, which doesn't necessarily include Kanye
     fans, but Adam's track has a popularity of 62. Additionally, Bon
     Iver is on the track 'Lost in the World' on 'My Beautiful Dark
     Twisted Fantasy,' which has a score of 58. He's also on
     'Monster,' but that track has so many other rappers on it, that
     it's popularity of 68 is likely more a factor of Nicki Minaj (who
     kills it in that song) than him. Coldplay, which is largely the
     band Chris Martin is associated with, has an overall popularity
     score of 89, only slightly lower than Kanye's score of 92. So
     clearly, there is a strong Chris Martin fan base on Spotify. </p>

     <p>Kanye himself seems to be pretty happy with the track. In 'Big
     Brother', he raps about Jay Z copying his good idea: </br></br>

     "I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay </br>
     Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay </br>
     Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way"

     <p>This begs the question, is Jay Z also negatively affected by
     having Chris Martin around? I ran a similar analysis on his
     albums. Below I show individual explicit Jay Z tracks, color-coded by
     album. The black solid line shows the mean popularity of the
     tracks, with the dashed lines showing the standard deviation. Chris Martin is featured on the track 'Beach
     Chair' on 'Kingdom Come.' It's the green point circled in gold below: </p>
     
<div class="plotdiv" id="c83e113f-8c34-4c87-82bb-2dd709c13ca4"></div>

     <p>Jay Z fans don't seem to have the same issue with Chris
     Martin. While the track is slightly lower than average in
     popularity, it is nowhere near the extremes we saw in Kanye's
     discography. Jay Z has his own extreme outlier, the song "The
     Return" on "Unfinished Business." Note that there are many more
     Jay Z albums, such as "Vol 2. Hard Knock Life," etc. However,
     these are not available for US markets, presumably due to his
     competing streaming service Tidal.</p>

     <p>Alright, so now we see while Kanye fans do not enjoy his
     collaboration with Chris Martin, Jay Z fans are pretty much
     neutral about his. Perhaps the song "Homecoming" is just not up to par...Except,
     the Recording Industry Association of America reports that it
     went Platinum, yet it is significantly less popular on Spotify
     than tracks that went Gold or did not rate at all. </p> 
     
     <p>This implies that Kanye fans on Spotify don't like Chris
     Martin. Since the song
     itself did well on the charts, it suggests that the general disdain for
     "Homecoming" is more a factor of Chris Martin than anything
     else. There are probably a number of factors related to the
     unpopularity of this track; unfortunately, I don't have access to Spotify data about
     listener demographics to learn more. All of that info is
     proprietary. So I'm going to look at a few more things, namely my
     original question: is it beneficial to work with Kanye? 
     </p>

    <div class="plotdiv" id="a7e52421-4655-4916-bec6-6adff405ad17"></div>

     <p>I used spotipy to pull out all of the tracks for each one of
     Kanye's collaborators. I then compared their solo song
     popularity to the popularity of their tracks with Kanye. Note
     that I have not trimmed out the Edited versions of these tracks,
     which leads to the lower overall popularity for each artist. The black dotted line
     shows a one-to-one relationship, namely that their own stuff is
     comparably popular to their material with Kanye. For the majority
     of artists, Kanye's presence has a positive affect on their track
     popularity, lying above the one-to-one relation. However, you can
     see that at around a popularity of 38, this changes. The red line
     shows a linear regression fit to the, admittedly sparse,
     points. As an artist is more popular on their own, Kanye West has a negative
     affect on their track popularity. For example, Nicki Minaj and
     John Legend are much more popular on their own than on their
     tracks with Kanye.</p>

    <p>Thus, while it is not necessarily beneficial for Kanye to
    collaborate with others on his own tracks, it is generally
    advantageous to work with Kanye, unless you're already quite a
    popular musician in your own right. On average, the mean popularity
    of a track with him is 9 points higher than one without him!
