Our family is exceedingly frustrated that this has NOT been repaired after notifying you over 2 weeks ago!!  This is a safety issue as on our street, this is the ONE & ONLY street light making this a high-risk for theft of car and home.  Our neighborhood has recently been plagued by car theft & break-ins so you can only imagine why we are angered by the fact that this light goes unrepaired; our street is dark beyond belief (see attached photo) and puts our family and neighbors at risk. Can someone in Management please call us at #858-560-4804 tomorrow so we can get this resolved immediately.

It gets very dark at night especially in front of my house. I called the City when I moved in but nobody called me back regarding the lights. While waiting for the City lights, I installed a sensor light in front of my house. It helped a bit for a while until something was wrong with my electricity and I have not fixed the circuit yet so my front yard gets very dark again. I was told that the City has a plan to put some lights on Lantana Dr.; however, it does not seem to happen soon. Last week (mid July), I found a condom on the street and a couple days later I found another condom (different color from the first one). The street is so dark that some people use the darkness to do business. Please come to my street and check how dark it is at night. It would be great if the street light plan happens soon. It has been too long (almost 3 years) waiting for the lights. Please help!!!",https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000001um5eAAA,Assigned,"Street Light Light Out at 4959 Lantana Drive, San Diego, CA, United States",2.0,1,60730027092.0,2709.0,1,1500000US060730027092,60730027092.0,32.4,29.7,32.8,1482.0,762.0,240.0,120.0,0.0,283.0,0.0,0.0,119.0,0.0,119.0,720.0,83.0,54.0,20.0,20.0,50.0,63.0,17.0,28.0,14.0,0.0,29.0,63.0,23.0,16.0,7.0,0.0,31964,67.0,420.0,15226,177.0,310.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,48.0,23.0,81.0,43.0,42.0,27.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,221600
