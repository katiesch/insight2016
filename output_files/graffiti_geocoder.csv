Upon witnessing this, our son ordered the kids to stop. They said the paint was water-soluble and that they'd clean it up. But they did not --- and they ran away. Afterwards, my son took photos of the graffiti ""artwork""  (included in this report). 
   At this time of the evening, It was dark outside, the lighting was not good, and it was hard to get details about the appearance of these kids. What my son does recall is:  one kid was Caucasian, had blonde hair, and wore a baseball cap which was turned around to the backside (and with a tuft of his blonde hair sticking out). The second boy had light brown skin. And the third kid was a little further back, and not easy to distinguish. 
     My son reported this graffiti act to the City of SD, last night, hoping that they will be able to clean it off the picnic table.
    And I reported it to my ""Next Door"" neighborhood website, last night.  Interestingly enough, I read reports from neighbors, this morning that graffiti was sprayed onto the Park Village Elementary School's ESS Building  (located across the street from the Penasquitos Creek Park), last night, as well.
     The neighbors on this neighborhood website encouraged me to send this report to you --- and in the future, I will be prompt in doing so, if we discover further graffiti problems.",Other,Graffiti,,,32.94480277881512-117.12761430664062,32.94480278,-117.1276143,,TRAFFIC - Traffic Control,5301.0,Graffiti Removal,,,,,Graffiti Removal,,https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t00000034aH6AAI,Street Division Closed Case,3004,017037,060730170373004,3

Transcription: Hi I'm calling to report some graffiti in the city of Delmar (I'm adding, it's actually in City of San Diego) that has been actually for several weeks I think it was initially wiped out and then come back again several weeks ago. It's on the corner of Mango Drive and Delmar Heights Road. The electricity post. I think that would be the East corner South East corner perhaps and yeah I just like to have that removed as soon as possible. It's pretty just tasteful and I've seen it there for a week now. Thank you.

I do not own the property but I am a tenant in the building. It was in the alley between Thomas and Reed off of Bayard where I park my car (Space 15 - far right next to the dumpster in the corner). I panicked when I saw them. I just wanted to get to my car as safely and quickly as possible so I could get to work. I didn't say anything to them for fear of getting attacked or my car vandalized later. All I remember is there were 3 guys. One guy who stared at me had short kind of spiky dirty blonde hair, maybe mid 30s, possibly homeless and in a light blue tshirt. One had a red bike. Green sack of clothes. Wish I had taken pics of them while driving away but I panicked and just wanted to get away from them. I didn't realize I should have called 9-1-1 since I've never encountered vandals before. In my panic the first number that Google popped up for SDPD was (619) 692-4800. I reported it to a gentleman on the phone and asked them if it was possible for someone to drive by and make sure they didn't tag any cars or other property nearby but not sure if anything was done. When I came home from work at approx. 7:30pm later I see that they tagged the fence and the side wall where I believe our electric meters are stored. Hope this info helps in any way.",Other,Graffiti,,,32.7935577-117.2533968,32.7935577,-117.2533968,1.50001E+11,TRAFFIC - Traffic Control,5301.0,Graffiti Removal,,N,NOPR,INPR,"853 Thomas Ave, San Diego, ...Graffit...",,https://getitdone.force.com//TSWViewReportDetail?Id=500t0000003BoZHAA0,Street Division,1021,007910,060730079101021,1
